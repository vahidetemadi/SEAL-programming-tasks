# Programming Task \# 2:
* For the first part, please see requirements to have he deps installed prior to running the program

* For counting LOC for each PL, you need a thrid patry tool, [Cloc] (https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) to analyze the souce code.

# How to use:
* For task #2_ part #1(stats) you need to introduce the action as "stat" (-a stat), and for part #2, to count LOCs this should be "LOC" (-a LOC). The program also takes github username as param too
* For both parts, you need to introduce username via -u (here is Kaggle), and your personal github token via -t, together with username for that token with -un (it's required since with no token, there is limitation in github api calls)
